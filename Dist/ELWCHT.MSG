[0;1;35mYou are currently in the Chatter Lounge. The Chatter Lounge is a
teleconference where you may choose an alias and talk under that alias.
This allows you to talk with total anonymity, so speak your mind!

To send an action you can use the "ga" command, for example:

  ga is laughing out loud.

This would send the following message to all other users in the
teleconference:

  <userid> is laughing out loud.

Note that little boys names appear in [0;1;34mblue[0;1;35m and little girls names appear
in [0;1;31mred[0;1;35m.[0m
