 WHAT IS CHAT LOUNGE?

 Chat Lounge is a simple teleconference which allows people to use aliases 
 for total anonymity. It includes generic action ("ga" command) support.
 
 USAGE

 Enter the module, provide an alias, and chat!  Everything you type
 goes out to everyone in the Chat Lounge.   
 
 COMMANDS
 
 Type your message, and it goes out to everyone present.  Just hitting enter
 will display a list of the aliases in the Chat Lounge.  Typing help or /h
 will provide a short help text.

 To send an action you can use the "ga" command, for example:
   ga is laughing out loud.

 This would send the following message to all other users in the Chat Lounge:
   <alias> is laughing out loud. 

 SysOps can use a "scan" command to learn the identity of users, if necessary.
  
 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
 
 Simply unzip the archive to your BBS directory, add the module to your menu,
 configure the MSG file to your liking, and start the BBS! It's that easy!

 MODULE HISTORY
 
 Chat Lounge was written and developed by Mike Polzin of WilderLand Software.
 Elwynor Technologies acquired the module in 2004, and ported it to Worldgroup
 v3.2 in February 2006. In September 2024, it was ported to Major BBS V10.
